# github-commit-automation

My own take on a Shell script that has been attempted multiple times by engineers/devs across the web - this is just what works for me. :)

## Installation

### 1. Create a shell file aywhere

Paste the content of the `github.sh` file in this repository within said shell script.

### 2. Add path to .zshrc

Copy the absolute path to the shell script and add an alias to your zash or bash config:

```
alias commit="PATH"
```

### 3. Make the shell script executable

Run the following command:

```
chmod +x "PATH"
```

## 4. Test

Run the command you inputted as an alias in your zsh/bash config in an existing git repo and you should be set!
